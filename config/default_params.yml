# Default Parameters for Assistive Robot Decision-Making System
# These parameters control the robot's decision-making and scoring logic

# Decision-making thresholds
recharge_threshold: 30  # Battery level (%) at which robot should consider recharging
critical_battery: 15    # Battery level (%) considered critically low
help_min_battery: 20    # Minimum battery (%) required to help user

# Scoring weights (must sum to 1.0 for safety + helpfulness)
safety_weight: 0.4      # Weight for safety considerations (0.0 - 1.0)
helpfulness_weight: 0.6 # Weight for helpfulness to user (0.0 - 1.0)

# Behavioral flags
proactive_recharge: false  # Whether to recharge proactively before critical levels

# Risk management
risk_tolerance: "Medium"  # Risk tolerance level: Low, Medium, High
# Risk buffer multiplier based on tolerance:
# - Low: 1.2 (very cautious)
# - Medium: 1.0 (balanced)
# - High: 0.8 (aggressive)
